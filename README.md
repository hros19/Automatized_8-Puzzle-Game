## Description 
This application plays the 8-Puzzle game by itself, where the user can choose between two algorithms (Backtraking and A*). It also allows you to customize the start board that the user wants, as well as a step-by-step solution to see how the algorithm behaves graphically.

## How to run the project ü§ñ
Opening the index.js file on your browser or you can deploy it [clicking here](https://hros19.github.io/Automatized_8-Puzzle-Game/).

## How to use the app ‚úçÔ∏è
You cant play as well, but you can change the environment in which the algorithms are going to be developed. Before going in to the buttons, you can select each position of the board and make your custom one, just becareful to select a valid board and a solvable board or the application would notice you.

Then, we have some buttons in the application, these are:
- **Soluci√≥n/Solution**: runs the algorithm is selected, the default algorithm is A*.
- **Cambiar/Change**: since there are only two, it alternates between the implemented algorithms (A*/Backtracking).
- **Sig Paso/Next step**: would perform a single step that the algorithm make, you can go ahead and view each movement the algorithm make to take a decision in every state of the game.
- **Reset**: reset to the initial status of the application, making restarting easy, without having to refresh the page.
- **Intercambiar/swap**: this button is associated with the input next to it. If you are viewing the algorithm step by step, you have the possibility of changing the state of the board to a preferred one (overriding the decision made by the algorithm).

## Credits :bow:
- We want to thanks [Geekforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org), we use this [algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-instance-8-puzzle-solvable/) to ensure that the board selected in the application have a solution, this is very useful because maybe (trust me, just maybe) the application could not work properly.
